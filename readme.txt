Toggles the WordPress admin bar the right way. Theme developer's best friend!

== Description ==

> Actually, there is a [great Chrome browser extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/wordpress-admin-bar-contr/joldejophkhmeajgjenfnfdpfjkalckn) that does the job perfectly fine.

**[WebMan Toggle Admin Bar](http://www.webmandesign.eu/ "WebMan Design") is WordPress plugin that provides an easy way to toggle the WordPress admin bar on your website's front end.**

This plugin actually toggles the whole admin bar functionality, so it gets rid of CSS styles and `.admin-bar` class that the WordPress admin bar applies. Thus, the plugin is perfectly suited for WordPress theme developers to test their themes with and without the admin bar.

Please note that once you click the plugin's button in the bottom left corner of the screen, the page will be reloaded. The plugin uses no JavaScript.
